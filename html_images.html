They are crepuscular, meaning they are most active at dawn and dusk, and have a wide field of vision that is nearly 360 degrees. Rabbits are herbivores and eat their own nutrient-rich droppings (cecotropes) to get the necessary nutrients they missed during the first pass through the digestive system. </p>
